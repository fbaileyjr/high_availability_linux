Fix in rev. 25:
-  Erroneous character found in skybox_watchdog.sh, removed character
- Removed soap_ping.pl and soap_ping.py
- Updated skybox_watchdog.sh with the function to perform the soap ping as part of its script
- Add req.xml (this is part of the API ping request)
- Updated setprimary.sh logic to allow the secondary to become active, even if there is an incron.primary file on the Primary server
- Correct redirect statement for setsecondary.sh script
- Path for mysqldump backupTicket.sh updated to reflect proper path depending on installed version

Fixes in rev. 24:
- Updated the MAIL_RECEIVER in skybox_ha.conf. The variable was misspelled causing other scripts to fail

Fixes of rev. 23:
- Updated the e-mail check in setprimary.sh. The false notification was caused by script was running. The proper logic has been put in place to check if the mail parameters have  been set.
- Updated skybox_watch.sh with the proper e-mail notification function. Only in the event of a failover will the e-mail be sent. I have tested and verified that this is working.
- Updated setprimary.sh, setsecondary.sh, and skybox_watchdog.sh with better logging logic. The code is cleaner and nicer to read
