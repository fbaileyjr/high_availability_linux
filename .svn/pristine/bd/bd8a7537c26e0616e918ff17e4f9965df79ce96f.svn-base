firewalld.zones \- firewalld zones
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.SS "What is a zone?"
.PP
A network zone defines the level of trust for network connections\&. This is a one to many relation, which means that a connection can only be part of one zone, but a zone can be used for many network connections\&.
.PP
The zone defines the firewall features that are enabled in this zone:
.sp
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBPredefined services\fR
.RS 4
.PP
A service is a combination of port and/or protocol entries\&. Optionally netfilter helper modules can be added and also a IPv4 and IPv6 destination address\&.
.RE
.sp
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBPorts and protocols\fR
.RS 4
.PP
Definition of
\fItcp\fR
or
\fIudp\fR
ports, where ports can be a single port or a port range\&.
.RE
.sp
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBICMP blocks\fR
.RS 4
.PP
Blocks selected Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) messages\&. These messages are either information requests or created as a reply to information requests or in error conditions\&.
.RE
.sp
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBMasquerading\fR
.RS 4
.PP
The addresses of a private network are mapped to and hidden behind a public IP address\&. This is a form of address translation\&.
.RE
.sp
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBForward ports\fR
.RS 4
.PP
A forward port is either mapped to the same port on another host or to another port on the same host or to another port on another host\&.
.RE
.sp
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1

\fBRich language rules\fR
.RS 4
.PP
The rich language extends the elements (service, port, icmp\-block, masquerade, forward\-port and source\-port) with additional source and destination addresses, logging, actions and limits for logs and actions\&. It can also be used for host or network white and black listing (for more information, please have a look at
\fBfirewalld.richlanguage\fR(5))\&.
.RE
.PP
For more information on the zone file format, please have a look at
\fBfirewalld.zone\fR(5)\&.
.SS "Which zones are available?"
.PP
Here are the zones provided by firewalld sorted according to the default trust level of the zones from untrusted to trusted:
.PP
drop
.RS 4
Any incoming network packets are dropped, there is no reply\&. Only outgoing network connections are possible\&.
.RE
.PP
block
.RS 4
Any incoming network connections are rejected with an
\fIicmp\-host\-prohibited\fR
message for IPv4 and
\fIicmp6\-adm\-prohibited\fR
for IPv6\&. Only network connections initiated within this system are possible\&.
.RE
.PP
public
.RS 4
For use in public areas\&. You do not trust the other computers on networks to not harm your computer\&. Only selected incoming connections are accepted\&.
.RE
.PP
external
.RS 4
For use on external networks with masquerading enabled especially for routers\&. You do not trust the other computers on networks to not harm your computer\&. Only selected incoming connections are accepted\&.
.RE
.PP
dmz
.RS 4
For computers in your demilitarized zone that are publicly\-accessible with limited access to your internal network\&. Only selected incoming connections are accepted\&.
.RE
.PP
work
.RS 4
For use in work areas\&. You mostly trust the other computers on networks to not harm your computer\&. Only selected incoming connections are accepted\&.
.RE
.PP
home
.RS 4
For use in home areas\&. You mostly trust the other computers on networks to not harm your computer\&. Only selected incoming connections are accepted\&.
.RE
.PP
internal
.RS 4
For use on internal networks\&. You mostly trust the other computers on the networks to not harm your computer\&. Only selected incoming connections are accepted\&.
.RE
.PP
trusted
.RS 4
All network connections are accepted\&.
.RE
.SS "Which zone should be used?"
.PP
A public WIFI network connection for example should be mainly untrusted, a wired home network connection should be fairly trusted\&. Select the zone that best matches the network you are using\&.
.SS "How to configure or add zones?"
.PP
To configure or add zones you can either use one of the firewalld interfaces to handle and change the configuration: These are the graphical configuration tool firewall\-config, the command line tool
\fBfirewall\-cmd\fR
or the D\-Bus interface\&. Or you can create or copy a zone file in one of the configuration directories\&.
\fI/usr/lib/firewalld/zones\fR
is used for default and fallback configurations and
\fI/etc/firewalld/zones\fR
is used for user created and customized configuration files\&.
.SS "How to set or change a zone for a connection?"
.PP
The zone is stored into the ifcfg of the connection with
\fBZONE=\fR
option\&. If the option is missing or empty, the default zone set in firewalld is used\&.
.PP
If the connection is controlled by NetworkManager, you can also use
\fBnm\-connection\-editor\fR
to change the zone\&.
