Fixes in rev. 24:
- Updated the MAIL_RECEIVER in skybox_ha.conf. The variable was misspelled causing other scripts to fail

Fixes of rev. 23:
- Updated the e-mail check in setprimary.sh. The false notification was caused by script was running. The proper logic has been put in place to check if the mai parameters have  been set.
- Updated skybox_watch.sh with the proper e-mail notification function. Only in the event of a failover will the e-mail be sent. I have tested and verified that this is working.
- Updated setprimary.sh, setsecondary.sh, and skybox_watchdog.sh with better logging logic. The code is cleaner and nicer to read
