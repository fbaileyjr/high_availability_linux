README for firewalld
====================

firewalld provides a dynamically managed firewall with support for network or 
firewall zones to define the trust level of network connections or interfaces. 
It has support for IPv4, IPv6 firewall settings and for ethernet bridges and a 
separation of runtime and permanent configuration options. It also provides an 
interface for services or applications to add ip*tables and ebtables rules 
directly. 


Development
-----------
To check out the source repository, you can use:

  git clone https://github.com/t-woerner/firewalld.git

This will create a local copy of the repository.


Working With The Source Repository
----------------------------------
You can use the source repository directly to test out changes. Change into the 
firewalld base directory and set the following environment variables.

  export FIREWALLD_DEVEL_ENV=$(pwd)/src
  export PYTHONPATH=$FIREWALLD_DEVEL_ENV

Install the following requirements or packages:

  desktop-file-utils: /usr/bin/desktop-file-install
  gettext
  intltool
  glib2: /usr/bin/glib-compile-schemas
  glib2-devel: /usr/share/aclocal/gsettings.m4
  systemd-units
  iptables
  ebtables
  ipset

For use with Python 3:

  python3-dbus
  python3-slip-dbus
  python3-decorator
  python3-gobject

For use with Python 2:

  dbus-python
  python-slip-dbus (http://fedorahosted.org/python-slip)
  python-decorator
  pygobject3-base (non-cairo parts of pygobject3)

To be able to create man pages and documentation from docbook files:

  docbook-style-xsl


Use

  ./autogen.sh

in the base directory to create for example src/firewall/config/__init__.py

Use

  make

to create the documentation and to update the po files.

Now you are done.


RPM package
-----------

For Fedora and RHEL based distributions, there is a spec file in the source
repo named firewalld.spec. This should be usable for Fedora versions >= 16 and
RHEL >= 7.
